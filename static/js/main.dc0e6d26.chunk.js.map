At our inception, networking was our primary platform. SHPE’s members — the Familia — are the heartbeat of the organization. Toward that end, SHPE quickly established two student chapters, creating a base that would grow to what we are today–a national organization with over 10,000 student and professional members and more than 225 chapters throughout the nation and in countries outside the United States. \n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            Today, SHPE’s educational programs and events directly serve tens of thousands each year representing a diverse Hispanic community, include: 1) children; 2) undergraduate and graduate students; and 3) academic and industry professionals. Many of these individuals are first-generation Americans and the first in their families to graduate college. \n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            SHPE at the University of Kansas has been a long-standing institution.
